### Folder: `Scripts`
The `Scripts` folder contains the main execution files that form the core functionality of the application. This folder is crucial as it manages video-to-image conversion, processing of the images, and integration with a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

#### 1. **integration.py**
   - **Purpose**: This script serves as the main orchestrator that integrates different components of the application, including image processing, RAG-based retrieval, and Gradio for the user interface.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Function `process_image(image)`**: 
       - Takes an image as input, saves it in an upload directory, and generates a unique filename using `UUID` for the image.
       - This function ensures that each image is stored with a unique name to avoid overwriting.
     - **Gradio Integration**:
       - Gradio is used to create a UI where users can upload images, and the uploaded image is processed using the `process_image()` function.
     - **External Imports**:
       - `Chatting`, `OpenProcessor`, `GPTProcessor`, and `VideoToImageConverter` are imported from `processor.py`, while `RAG` is imported from `rag.py`.
       - These imports indicate that `integration.py` acts as a control script, leveraging the functionality provided by the other modules.
   - **Control Flow**:
     - Users interact with the Gradio UI to upload an image.
     - The image is processed and stored with a unique filename.
     - The processed image or any other data can be fed into the RAG system (via functions in `rag.py`) for retrieval-based tasks.

#### 2. **processor.py**
   - **Purpose**: Handles various processing tasks related to images and videos, including converting video frames into images and managing GPT-based processing for chat or other tasks.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Class `VideoToImageConverter`**:
       - **Method `__init__(self, video_path, output_dir)`**: Initializes the converter with a video file path and the output directory where the extracted images will be saved.
       - **Method `extract_images(self)`**: 
         - Uses `OpenCV` to open the video file, iterates through each frame, and saves frames as images in the output directory.
         - This method is useful for breaking down a video into its constituent frames for further processing.
     - **Class `OpenProcessor`**:
       - Placeholder for functions related to OpenAI or GPT-based processing (based on the imports from `langchain_ollama` and GPT-related libraries).
     - **External Dependencies**:
       - `cv2` for handling image and video processing.
       - `langchain_ollama`, `dotenv`, and other external libraries that indicate some level of integration with external services or APIs for language modeling tasks.

   - **Control Flow**:
     - The video is passed to `VideoToImageConverter`, where each frame is extracted and stored.
     - The `OpenProcessor` and related classes likely handle GPT-based processing or retrieval tasks.

#### 3. **rag.py**
   - **Purpose**: Handles the implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, responsible for storing and retrieving information in response to user queries.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Class `RAG`**:
       - **Method `__init__(self)`**: Initializes the RAG system by connecting to a ChromaDB instance running on localhost. The `client` attribute stores the HTTP client connection, and `collection` is used to manage document collections.
       - **Method `getcollection(self, collection_name)`**:
         - Retrieves or creates a collection in ChromaDB by its name. This method is crucial for managing different data collections for RAG tasks.
       - **Method `add(self, data)`**:
         - Adds documents to the current collection, attaching metadata and assigning unique IDs to the documents. This method allows the RAG system to index and store new data for retrieval later.
     - **ChromaDB Integration**:
       - This file integrates with **ChromaDB** for document storage and retrieval. ChromaDB is a vector database, often used in RAG systems to store and retrieve documents based on semantic similarity.
   - **Control Flow**:
     - The system connects to ChromaDB on initialization.
     - Data (e.g., documents, images) can be added to collections in ChromaDB.
     - These collections are then used for retrieval when a query is passed into the RAG system.

### Control Flow Between Files:

1. **Integration with `integration.py`**:
   - This file acts as the primary orchestrator of the system. It imports functionality from `processor.py` to process images or videos and from `rag.py` to manage the retrieval tasks.
   
2. **Image and Video Processing (`processor.py`)**:
   - Video files are converted into individual frames via the `VideoToImageConverter`. These frames can then be stored or processed further by GPT-related processors in the same file.

3. **RAG Operations (`rag.py`)**:
   - Once the data (e.g., images or text) is processed, it can be stored in ChromaDB collections via the `RAG` class in `rag.py`. This data can then be queried and retrieved as needed.

### Tech Stack:

1. **Python**: The entire application is written in Python.
2. **Gradio**: Used to create the web interface for uploading images and interacting with the system.
3. **OpenCV**: Used for video frame extraction and image processing.
4. **ChromaDB**: A vector database used in the RAG system for semantic retrieval of documents or data.
5. **Langchain and OpenAI**: Likely used for natural language processing and interaction with language models (e.g., GPT).

### Common Errors, Reasons, and Solutions:

| Error                    | Reason                                                 | Solution                                                   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ModuleNotFoundError`     | A required module (e.g., `opencv-python`, `langchain_ollama`) is missing | Ensure that all dependencies are installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. |
| `FileNotFoundError`       | The video or image file path is incorrect or missing   | Verify the file paths being passed, and ensure files exist. |
| `ConnectionError`         | Cannot connect to ChromaDB server                      | Make sure that the ChromaDB service is running on the correct host and port. |
| `cv2.error`               | Issues with reading or processing a video file         | Ensure the video format is supported by OpenCV and that the file is not corrupted. |
| `KeyError: 'collection'`  | Trying to access a collection in ChromaDB that doesnâ€™t exist | Use the `getcollection()` method to create or fetch the collection before accessing it. |
